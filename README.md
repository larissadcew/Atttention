## Overview of the Masked Language Model with BERT

In this project, we are utilizing a Masked Language Model (MLM) approach, which is a fundamental concept in natural language processing (NLP). The MLM task involves predicting a word in a given sentence by masking it and relying on the surrounding context to make an accurate prediction. This method is used to train models like **BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)**, developed by Google. BERT has revolutionized NLP by providing a context-aware language representation, which enables the model to consider both the left and right context of a word during training, as opposed to traditional models that only look at one direction.

## Key Concepts and Technologies Used

### BERT (Bidirectional Encoder Representations from Transformers)

- BERT is based on the Transformer architecture, which uses self-attention mechanisms to weigh the importance of each word in a sequence relative to the others
